This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece. The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade.The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny.\n",

The intense sadness of \"Prisoners of Fate\" (which means all the more if you've played the game) and the hope in \"A Distant Promise\" and \"Girl who Stole the Star\" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years. The higher energy tracks like \"Chrono Cross ~ Time's Scar~\", \"Time of the Dreamwatch\", and \"Chronomantique\" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well.This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer's work (I haven't heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can't say for sure), and even if you've never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it.I wish I could give it 6 stars.\n",

Garden Of God, Chronopolis, Fates, Jellyfish sea, Burning Orphange, Dragon's Prayer, Tower Of Stars, Dragon God, and Radical Dreamers - Unstealable Jewel.Overall, this is a excellent soundtrack and should be brought by those that like video game music.Xander Cross\n",

It has everything for every listener -- from fast-paced and energetic (Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home), to slower and more haunting (Dragon God), to purely beautifully composed (Time's Scar), to even some fantastic vocals (Radical Dreamers).This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there, and surely Mitsuda's best ever. ^_^\n",

I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another. It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a \"worst book\" contest. I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing. Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"--a book I am quite sure Ms. Haddon never heard of.

      "Jobst UltraSheer Thigh High: Excellent product. However, they are very difficult to get on for older people. I feel like I've had a full day workout after getting them on. Also, as the day wears on, they begin to roll down from the top and create a very deep ridge in the skin. I have to wear them, so if those two difficulties could be addressed it would be such a help.\n",

Solution: go with the standard compression stocking, 20-30, stock #114622. Excellent support, stays up and gives me what I need. Both pair of these also tore as I struggled to pull them up all the time. Good riddance/bad investment!\n",

      "Delicious cookie mix: I thought it was funny that I bought this product without knowing it was a mix. I read the header very quickly and just thought it was packaged cookies. But no, it is cookie MIX and I guess I should have noticed that since it is right in the title.This is the first time I have ever tried baking with a cookie mix. If you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise. Mixing up the dough can get VERY messy (it is extremely sticky). However, with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients (I like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy). Also, this mix has really large chocolate chips in it--I love that.I removed a star for the addition of 'natural flavors' in the mix.\n",

      "Another Abysmal Digital Copy: Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution. Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer.If you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white. The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded. Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visuals.After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE. Somewhere \"out there\" is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reel.Just none of them appear to be on Amazon.\n",

      "A fascinating insight into the life of modern Japanese teens: I thoroughly enjoyed Rising Sons and Daughters. I don't know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community, and their peers' adulation of Western culture. True to form, the \"New Young\" of Japan seem to be creating an \"international\" blend, as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family. Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author, adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens, and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out. A great read!\n",
